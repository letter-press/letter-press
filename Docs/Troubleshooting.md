# Troubleshooting

This guide covers common issues, debugging strategies, and solutions for Letter-Press CMS development and deployment.

## Common Issues

### Development Issues

#### Build Errors

**Vite Build Fails**
- Clear cache and reinstall dependencies using `rm -rf node_modules .vite dist` followed by package manager install
- Increase Node.js memory limit using NODE_OPTIONS environment variable for large builds
- Check for module resolution issues and verify import paths

**TypeScript Errors**
- Regenerate Prisma client and types after schema changes
- Run typecheck command to identify type conflicts
- Update peer dependencies to resolve version conflicts

**SolidStart SSR Issues**
- Use ClientOnly component for client-specific code that accesses browser APIs
- Add proper server guards to prevent server-side execution of browser code
- Check for hydration mismatches between server and client rendering

#### Database Issues

**Prisma Connection Errors**
- Verify DATABASE_URL format includes all required parameters
- Test connection using Prisma CLI pull command
- Reset database in development using migrate reset (caution: destroys data)

**Migration Failures**
- Check current migration state using Prisma migrate status
- Resolve conflicts manually using migrate resolve command
- Force reset in development environments only

**Performance Issues**
- Analyze slow queries using pg_stat_statements extension
- Add missing indexes for frequently queried columns
- Monitor connection pool usage and optimize settings

#### Plugin System Issues

**Plugin Not Loading**
- Verify plugin directory structure includes required main.ts and package.json files
- Check that main.ts exports default class implementing Plugin interface
- Review plugin manager error logs for loading failures

**Hook Not Executing**
- Verify hook registration in plugin hooks object
- Check plugin activation status through plugin manager
- Debug hook execution flow using plugin manager debugging features

### Production Issues

#### Deployment Failures

**Vercel Deployment Issues**
- Check vercel.json configuration for function timeout settings
- Verify environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard or CLI
- Review build logs for dependency or compilation errors

**Docker Build Issues**
- Use proper user permissions in Dockerfile to avoid EACCES errors
- Generate Prisma client in build stage before application compilation
- Optimize multi-stage builds for smaller production images

**Database Connection in Production**
- Optimize connection pool settings for production workloads
- Add SSL mode to connection string for secure cloud databases
- Monitor connection pool exhaustion and adjust limits

#### Performance Issues

**Slow Page Loads**
- Enable query logging to identify N+1 query problems
- Optimize database queries using include relations instead of separate queries
- Select only needed fields to reduce data transfer

**Memory Leaks**
- Monitor memory usage patterns using process.memoryUsage()
- Properly close database connections using $disconnect()
- Clear intervals, timeouts, and event listeners to prevent leaks

**High CPU Usage**
- Profile Node.js application using built-in profiler
- Monitor processes using PM2 or similar process managers
- Check for infinite loops or blocking synchronous operations

## Debugging Strategies

### Development Debugging

**Server-Side Debugging**
- Enable debug logging using debug package for targeted logging
- Use strategic console.log statements for request tracking
- Implement error boundaries for better error tracking and recovery

**Client-Side Debugging**
- Use browser developer tools for network, console, and performance analysis
- Implement Solid DevTools for component state inspection
- Use console timing methods to measure operation performance

**Database Query Debugging**
- Enable Prisma query logging with event listeners
- Log query duration and parameters for performance analysis
- Use raw SQL for complex debugging scenarios

### Production Debugging

**Structured Logging**
- Implement Winston or similar logging library with appropriate levels
- Include context information like user ID, request ID, and timestamps
- Set up log aggregation and searching for production environments

**Error Tracking with Sentry**
- Initialize Sentry with environment and release information
- Capture exceptions with context and user information
- Set up performance monitoring and alerting

**Health Monitoring**
- Implement health check endpoints that verify system components
- Monitor database connectivity, plugin status, and resource usage
- Set up external monitoring services for availability checks

## Plugin Debugging

### Plugin Development

**Plugin Error Isolation**
- Use debug package for plugin-specific logging with namespaces
- Implement try-catch blocks to prevent plugin errors from breaking core functionality
- Return original data when plugin processing fails

**Plugin Testing**
- Write unit tests for plugin hooks and functionality
- Test error handling scenarios with invalid data
- Implement integration tests for plugin interaction with core system

### Plugin Runtime Issues

**Plugin Not Found**
- Check plugin discovery by listing plugin directory contents
- Review plugin manager load errors for specific failure reasons
- Verify plugin file permissions and accessibility

**Hook Execution Problems**
- Debug hook execution order and results using plugin manager debugging
- Check for hook timeout issues or blocking operations
- Verify plugin activation status and hook registration

## Performance Optimization

### Database Optimization

**Query Analysis**
- Enable pg_stat_statements extension for query performance tracking
- Identify slow queries and optimize with appropriate indexes
- Monitor index usage and database statistics

**Index Optimization**
- Create composite indexes for common query patterns
- Use partial indexes for filtered queries
- Implement full-text search indexes for content searching

### Application Optimization

**Code Splitting**
- Implement lazy loading for admin components and large features
- Use route-based splitting for better initial load performance
- Split vendor bundles to improve caching effectiveness

**Caching Strategies**
- Implement in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Use Redis for distributed caching in production environments
- Set appropriate cache TTL values and invalidation strategies
