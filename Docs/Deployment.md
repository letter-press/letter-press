# Deployment Guide

This guide covers deploying Letter-Press CMS to production environments with various hosting providers and deployment strategies.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ runtime environment
- PostgreSQL database (local or hosted)
- Domain name with SSL certificate
- Basic understanding of environment variables

## Environment Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.production` file with essential variables:

- Connection pool settings for production workloads

**Authentication**
- AUTH_SECRET: Cryptographically secure secret key (minimum 32 characters)
- AUTH_TRUST_HOST: Enable trusted host verification
- Session configuration and cookie settings

**Application Settings**
- NODE_ENV: Set to production
- PORT: Application port (default 3000)
- HOSTNAME: Bind address for server

**External Services (Optional)**
- SMTP configuration for email notifications
- File storage credentials (S3, CloudFlare R2)
- Monitoring and logging service credentials

### Security Configuration

Generate strong authentication secrets using secure random generators. Configure CORS settings for your domain. Set up rate limiting parameters and file upload restrictions.

## Database Setup

### Managed Database Options (Recommended)

**Neon Database**
- Sign up at neon.tech and create a new project
- PostgreSQL-compatible with automatic scaling
- Built-in connection pooling and branching
- Copy connection string with SSL mode required

**PlanetScale**
- MySQL-compatible serverless database
- Automatic scaling and branching
- Generate connection string with SSL settings

**Supabase**
- PostgreSQL with additional features
- Real-time subscriptions and storage
- Dashboard for database management

**Railway PostgreSQL**
- Simple PostgreSQL deployment
- Automatic backups and monitoring
- One-click database creation

### Self-Hosted PostgreSQL

Install PostgreSQL on your server, create database and user with appropriate permissions. Configure connection limits, memory settings, and backup schedules.

### Database Migration

Install production dependencies, generate Prisma client, run database migrations, and optionally seed initial data.

## Build Process

### Production Build

Install production dependencies only, build the application with optimizations, and test the production build locally before deployment.

### Build Optimization

Configure build settings for production including minification, code splitting, and bundle optimization. Set up proper environment variable handling and optimize for your target platform.

## Deployment Platforms

### Vercel (Recommended)

Install Vercel CLI and configure project settings. Set up environment variables through the dashboard or CLI. Deploy with automatic CI/CD integration from your git repository.

**Configuration Steps:**
- Configure vercel.json with framework settings
- Set up environment variables in dashboard
- Configure build commands and output directory
- Enable automatic deployments from git

### Netlify

Configure netlify.toml with build settings and redirects. Set up environment variables and deploy either through git integration or CLI.

**Configuration Steps:**
- Set up build command and publish directory
- Configure redirects for SPA routing
- Set environment variables
- Enable form handling if needed

### Railway

Simple deployment with automatic Docker builds. Configure railway.toml with service settings. Deploy directly from git repository with automatic builds.

**Configuration Steps:**
- Connect git repository
- Configure environment variables
- Set up custom domains
- Configure health check endpoints

### DigitalOcean App Platform

Create app specification file with service configuration. Set up database connections and environment variables. Deploy with automatic scaling and load balancing.

**Configuration Steps:**
- Configure app.yaml specification
- Set up database service
- Configure environment variables
- Set up custom domains and SSL

### Docker Deployment

Create production Dockerfile with multi-stage builds. Use docker-compose for local development and production deployments. Configure nginx reverse proxy and SSL termination.

**Docker Setup:**
- Multi-stage build for optimization
- Production-ready image with security hardening
- Docker Compose configuration with database
- Nginx configuration for reverse proxy

### VPS/Dedicated Server

Complete server setup including system updates, Node.js installation, database setup, reverse proxy configuration, and SSL certificate management.

**Server Setup Steps:**
1. Update system packages and install Node.js 18+
2. Install and configure PostgreSQL
3. Install and configure Nginx
4. Set up SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
5. Configure PM2 for process management
6. Set up monitoring and logging

**Application Deployment:**
- Clone repository and install dependencies
- Build application for production
- Configure PM2 ecosystem file
- Set up Nginx virtual host
- Configure SSL certificates and security headers

**PM2 Configuration:**
- Cluster mode for multiple instances
- Automatic restart on failure
- Log rotation and monitoring
- Environment variable management

**Nginx Configuration:**
- Reverse proxy to Node.js application
- SSL termination and security headers
- Static file serving and caching
- Gzip compression and performance optimization

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Health Checks

Implement health check endpoints that verify database connectivity, plugin status, and system resources. Configure monitoring services to regularly check endpoint availability.

### Logging

Set up structured logging with appropriate log levels. Configure log rotation and retention policies. Use external logging services for production environments.

### Backup Strategy

Implement automated database backups with retention policies. Set up file system backups for uploaded media. Store backups in external locations like S3.

**Backup Components:**
- Database dumps with compression
- Media file archives
- Configuration file backups
- Automated scheduling with cron jobs
- Cloud storage integration for off-site backups

### Performance Monitoring

Set up application performance monitoring with metrics collection. Monitor database query performance and optimize slow queries. Track memory usage and response times.

**Monitoring Areas:**
- HTTP request duration and status codes
- Database query performance and connection pool usage
- Memory usage and garbage collection metrics
- Active plugin count and plugin performance

## Security Considerations

### Rate Limiting

Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks. Configure different limits for different endpoints and user types.

### Security Headers

Configure comprehensive security headers including Content Security Policy, HSTS, and XSS protection. Implement proper CORS settings for your domain.

### SSL/TLS Configuration

Use strong SSL/TLS configuration with modern cipher suites. Implement HSTS and certificate pinning where appropriate.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Database Connection Errors**
- Verify DATABASE_URL format and credentials
- Check firewall settings and network connectivity
- Ensure database server is running and accessible

**Build Failures**
- Clear node_modules and package caches
- Verify Node.js version compatibility
- Check for missing environment variables

**Memory Issues**
- Monitor memory usage patterns
- Increase server memory allocation
- Optimize database queries and caching

**SSL Certificate Issues**
- Verify domain DNS settings point to correct server
- Check certificate expiration dates
- Ensure ports 80 and 443 are open and accessible

### Performance Optimization

**Database Optimization**
- Configure PostgreSQL memory settings
- Set up connection pooling
- Add appropriate indexes for query performance
- Enable query optimization features

**Application Optimization**
- Enable gzip compression
- Configure proper caching headers
- Implement CDN for static assets
- Use code splitting and lazy loading
